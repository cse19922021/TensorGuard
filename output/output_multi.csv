- The bug fix involves updating the calculation of `canonical_axis` by passing the size of the `in` vector as the second argument to the `canonical_axis_index_` function, instead of `in[0].dims_size()`.

This leads to a null pointer exception in the Go code when trying to create a slice from the data.

","The root cause of the bug is the missing parameter check in the shape function of the `ParameterizedTruncatedNormal` operation. The parameters of `ParameterizedTruncatedNormal` should be 0-D or 1-D, but there was no validation in the shape function to ensure this. This led to potential errors when invalid parameters were provided, as the validation was only performed in the kernel functions. The bug was fixed by updating the shape function to check the parameters of `ParameterizedTruncatedNormal` whenever possible.","The common fixing pattern in the given code change is replacing a function call with a lambda function. 

In the original code, the function `shape_inference::RandomShape` is called using `.SetShapeFn(shape_inference::RandomShape)`.

In the code change, the function call is replaced with a lambda function:

```
.SetShapeFn([](InferenceContext* c) {
  ShapeHandle unused;
  // Parameters must be 0-d or 1-d.
  TF_RETURN_IF_ERROR(c->WithRankAtMost(c->input(1), 1, &unused));

  TF_RETURN_IF_ERROR(c->WithRankAtMost(c->input(4), 1, &unused));
  return shape_inference::RandomShape(c);
});

This pattern allows for more flexibility and customization within the function call by providing a lambda function that can include additional logic or checks before calling the `shape_inference::RandomShape` function."
