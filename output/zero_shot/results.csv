This could have affected the accuracy or reliability of the solver's calculations, leading to incorrect results or unexpected behavior in the system.",This code change adds a conditional block that exports a model to a proto file for debugging purposes. The block is only executed if the `PLATFORM_GOOGLE` conditional compilation flag is defined.
