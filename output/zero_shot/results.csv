#endif","The bug was caused by exporting the solver model for debugging, which likely led to unintended changes in the behavior of the solver or introduced errors in the exported model itself. This could have affected the accuracy or reliability of the solver's calculations, leading to incorrect results or unexpected behavior in the system.",This code change adds a conditional block that exports a model to a proto file for debugging purposes. The block is only executed if the `PLATFORM_GOOGLE` conditional compilation flag is defined.

The commit message indicates that this bug was fixed by applying clang-tidy fixes for this specific issue.,"The fixing pattern in the code change is updating the variable names from camelCase to lowerCamelCase to match the naming convention used in the codebase. 

Specifically, the following changes were made:
- `/*is_uniform_sized=*/true` was changed to `/*isUniformSized=*/true`
- `/*operand_types=*/{operand().getType()}` was changed to `/*operandTypes=*/{operand().getType()}`
- `/*result_types=*/{getType()}` was changed to `/*resultTypes=*/{getType()}`

If this condition is met, a log message is outputted to provide information on the override along with relevant details such as the tensor data type and the full key."

- A new functionality to dump the MLIR representation of `mlir_module` to a file or stdout based on the condition `DumpingEnabledForHloModule(*hlo_module)` is added.
- The MLIR representation is generated by calling `mlir_module.print(tfrt_mlir_ostream)`.
- Then, the MLIR representation is dumped to a file or stdout using `DumpToFileInDirOrStdout(*hlo_module, """", ""tfrt_mlir"", tfrt_mlir)`.
- Finally, the function `LowerToBef` is called with an additional parameter `hlo_module`."
