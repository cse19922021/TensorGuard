+  }","gather_expanded_index_stub(result.device().type(), result, self, dim, index);","The root cause of the bug is that the current implementation of `gather` in PyTorch was inefficient for Graph Neural Network (GNN) usage on CPU. Specifically, when performing message passing in GNNs, the `gather` operation had an `index` tensor with a broadcasted shape (e.g., `5000, 128` with stride `[1, 0]`), indicating that the gather operation was done on each row of the self tensor. However, the implementation tried to parallelize on the inner dimension, leading to poor performance on CPU and the inability to vectorize the operation.

To address this issue, the optimization was done to parallelize on the outer dimension of the `index` tensor and perform vectorized copy on the inner dimension. This optimization significantly improved the performance of `gather` for GNN models, reducing the time from `150.787ms` to `10.926ms` on a specific hardware configuration. This improvement ensures that `gather` is no longer a major bottleneck for training GNN models when the `EdgeIndex` is in COO format.

For more details, the GitHub issue related to this optimization can be found at https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/issues/4891#issuecomment-1288423705.","The fixing pattern in this code change is to add a new dispatch function `gather_expanded_index_stub` and then check if the expanded index path can be used. If yes, then call `gather_expanded_index_stub` with appropriate arguments, otherwise fall back to the original `gather_stub` function."

```cpp

    // Only record CPU/GPU graphs that are qualified but filtered out
    if (HasQualifiedNonTPUOp(graph)) {

          /*fallback_enabled*/ false,
          /*result*/ ""invalid_graph"");
    }
```

After the change:
```cpp
if (!run_tpu_bridge && !HasQualifiedNonTPUOp(graph)) {
    // Only record CPU/GPU graphs that are qualified but filtered out
